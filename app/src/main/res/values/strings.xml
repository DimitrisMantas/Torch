    <string name="info">To navigate the map, double tap or pinch to zoom in, tap with two fingers to zoom out, and scroll with two fingers to tilt.\n\nTo select an origin and a destination, either enter their coordinates into text field on top of your screen, or long-press the corresponding locations on the map. Please note that you can select a destination only after you have selected an origin.\n\nTo center the map, press the button showing a dark teal and orange compass needle on the top right of your screen. The map is centered according to both its position and what is on screen,  so you may have to press this button multiple times to achieve the desired results. Alternatively, you can long-press the button to accelerate this process.\n\nTo find the shortest route between the selected origin and destination by length, press the large dark teal button on the bottom right of your screen. You can access different routing modes by long-pressing this button. Please note that you can route only if no previous route is already on screen (including the corresponding pins), and both an origin and a destination have been selected. You can always clear the current route (along with the corresponding origin and destination) by pressing the button showing a dark teal trash can above the routing button.\n\nFor more information about Torch, please visit its <a href="https://github.com/DimitrisMantas/Torch">GitHub page</a>.\n\nTorch was made possible with <a href="https://github.com/google/flatbuffers">Google FlatBuffers</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mapsforge/vtm">VTM</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/opensciencemap">OpenScienceMap</a> project.

    <string name="permission_rationale_message">Torch needs permission to write its data to your device. This includes critical mMap and routing files. Without them, Torch will not be able to show you a mMap of the currently supported regions, or provide relevant routing services.
